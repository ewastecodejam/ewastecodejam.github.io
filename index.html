      <h1> Welcome to the E-Waste Code Jam 2022!</h1>
      <p>The idea for the E-Waste code jam is in the name. A code jam this year which will have a topic on E-Waste so that many people may submit their own projects in the hopes of winning. While your goal may be to win this code jam; the real goal is to help spread awareness about E-Waste. E-Waste is a growing problem throughout the world as we begin to manufacture and dispose of more and more technology. Many different resources go into making the components which help power your laptop, phone, and toaster. By constantly upgrading devices and disposing of old ones, more E-Waste is generated than necessary.</p>
      <h1>Do you want to sign up?</h1>
      <p>Do you have an idea for a website, a video game, or an application that could help us shine a light on the problem that is E-Waste? Great! Head over to "The Jam" button at the top of the screen. Just follow the instructions on that website and we will be sure to see you there! You have until May 28th 2022 at 12:00pm Pacific Standard Time.</p>

                The idea of the E-Waste code jam is in the name. A code jam this year which will have the topic of E-Waste so that people may submit their own projects in the hopes of winning. While your goal may be to win this code jam, the real goal is to help spread awareness about E-Waste. E-Waste is a growing problem throughout the world as we begin to use more and more technology. Many different minerals go into making the components which help power your laptop, phone, and toaster. By constantly upgrading devices and throwing out old ones for more E-Waste is generated than neccesary.

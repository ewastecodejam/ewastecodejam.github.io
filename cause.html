                We want to help raise awareness about the growing issue of E-Waste. Considering how crucial digital technology has become in the modern world it is everyones responsibility to think about the consequences. 
                <br><br>
                The main issue of E-Waste is the over consumption of technology. Everytime a new iPhone is released hoards of people drive to the apple store to purchase it. This is done while simultanioously throwing out their old phone. The same is true for any piece of technology from laptops to toasters.
                <br><br>
                Something anyone can do is reduce the amount of new electronics they purchase every year. One of the reasons e-waste has developed into such a big problem is because of the consumer culture surrounding big electronics companies like Apple and Samsung. Understandibly you ay have to purchase new electronics for work, school etc... The problem is over consumption, be sure to keep that in mind next time you purchase a new laptop.
                <br><br>
                Something else you can do is buy used electronics provided they are working. This is good for two reasons: it reduces waste, and will probably save you some money.
                <br><br>
                Another way you can help is by properly disposing of old electronics. Many cities will have designated recycling depots where they can ensure the e-waste is dealt with properly and safely. If you follow these few guidelines we can make sure that we reduce E-Waste all accross the globe.
            </p>
            
            <h1>
                Why Should You Help?
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                We only have one earth, there is currently no backup planet and even if there was, this still would not be a viable option. If you care about the community and those who live within it you will help reduce E-Waste by finding recycling centres and by stopping over consumption in your household.<br>
                
                If that hasn't convinced you here are the stats:<br>
                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>638,000 Metric Tonnes of E-Waste generated in Canada in 1 Year</li>
                <li>Projected to be over 9,000,000 Metric Tonnes  in 2025 (3 Years)</li>
                <li>It requires <strong>240</strong>kg of Fossil Fuels to manufacture a new computer</li>
                    
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Those alarming figures demonstrate just how urgent it is that we act. Don't buy a new phone just because a new one got released. Don't throw out your broken radio, either find somewhere to recycle it or try to fix it. We will obviously need technology in the future, but we can absolutley reduce the amount of waste which it creates.

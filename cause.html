      <h1>Our Cause</h1>
      <p>We want to help raise awareness about the growing issue of E-Waste. Given how crucial digital technology has become in the modern world, it is now everybody's responsibility to think about the consequences of E-Waste.<br>
        <br>The primary issue with E-Waste is the over consumption of technology. Whenever a new smartphone model is released, hoards of people drive to the store to purchase it. This is done while simultaneously throwing out their old smartphone. The same is true for any piece of technology, from laptops to toasters.<br>
        <br>Something that you can do to reduce E-Waste is to buy used electronics, provided they are working. This is good for two reasons: it reduces waste, and it will probably save you some money.<br>
        <br>Another way you can reduce the growing E-Waste problem is by properly disposing of old electronics. Many cities have designated recycling depots where they actively ensure that E-Waste is dealt with properly and safely. If you follow these few guidelines, we can make sure that we reduce E-Waste all across the globe.
      </p>
      <h1>Why Should You Help?</h1>
      <p>We only have one earth; there is currently no backup planet, and even if there was, this still would not be a viable option. If you really care about the community and those who live within it, you should help reduce E-Waste by finding recycling centers and by stopping over-consumption within your household. If that hasn't yet convinced you here are some of the stats:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>638,000 Metric Tonnes of E-Waste generated in Canada in 1 Year</li>
        <li>Projected to be over 9,000,000 Metric Tonnes in 2025 (3 Years)</li>
        <li>It requires <b>240</b>kg of Fossil Fuels to manufacture a new computer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those alarming figures alone demonstrate just how urgent it is that we act now. We urge you not to buy a new phone just because a new one got released. Don't throw out your broken radio; either find somewhere to recycle it or try to fix it. We obviously will need technology in the future, so we need to reduce the amount of waste which it creates.</p>
